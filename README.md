# 🏦 Compound Protocol Wallet Risk Scorer

A comprehensive risk assessment tool that analyzes wallet interactions with Compound V2 protocol to generate risk scores from 0-1000. Built with Streamlit and powered by Moralis API for accurate DeFi data analysis.

## 📊 Overview

This application automatically processes CSV files containing Ethereum wallet addresses and performs deep risk analysis based on their historical and current interactions with the Compound lending protocol. The system provides actionable risk scores with detailed breakdowns for financial institutions, DeFi protocols, and risk management teams.

## 🚀 Features

- **Batch Processing**: Analyze unlimited wallet addresses from CSV uploads
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live progress tracking with comprehensive error handling
- **Comprehensive Risk Scoring**: Multi-factor risk assessment with weighted scoring model
- **Export Capabilities**: Download results in CSV format with detailed metrics
- **API Integration**: Powered by Moralis API for reliable blockchain data

## 📈 Data Collection Method

### Primary Data Sources

The application leverages Moralis API to collect comprehensive wallet data:

**ERC-20 Token Balances** (`/erc20` endpoint)
- Current holdings of Compound tokens (cETH, cDAI, cUSDC, etc.)
- Real-time USD valuations for accurate position sizing
- Token metadata for proper categorization

**ERC-20 Transfer History** (`/erc20/transfers` endpoint)
- Historical interactions with Compound protocol tokens
- Transaction timestamps for temporal analysis
- Transfer amounts and USD values at transaction time

**General Transaction Data** (wallet transaction endpoint)
- Overall wallet activity patterns
- Gas usage patterns and transaction frequency
- Cross-protocol interaction analysis

### Compound Protocol Detection

The system identifies Compound-related activities through:
- **Contract Address Mapping**: Known Compound V2 token contracts
- **Token Symbol Recognition**: Automatic detection of 'c' prefixed tokens
- **Transaction Pattern Analysis**: Supply, borrow, redeem, and repay operations

## 🎯 Feature Selection Rationale

### Core Risk Features

Our feature selection is based on established DeFi risk assessment principles:

#### 1. Leverage & Position Features
- **Borrow Ratio**: `net_borrow / total_borrowed`
  - *Rationale*: High retention of borrowed amounts indicates potential repayment issues
- **Net Position**: `total_supplied - net_borrowed`
  - *Rationale*: Positive net positions indicate conservative behavior
- **Current Balance**: USD value of active Compound positions
  - *Rationale*: Large positions require more sophisticated risk management

#### 2. Activity & Behavioral Features
- **Transaction Frequency**: `total_transactions / account_age_days`
  - *Rationale*: Regular activity suggests active portfolio management
- **Account Age**: Days since first Compound interaction
  - *Rationale*: Established accounts demonstrate experience and stability
- **Days Since Last Activity**: Time elapsed since most recent transaction
  - *Rationale*: Recent inactivity may indicate abandonment or issues

#### 3. Diversification Features
- **Unique Tokens**: Number of different Compound tokens used
  - *Rationale*: Diversification reduces concentration risk
- **Total Transaction Count**: Overall activity level
  - *Rationale*: More transactions indicate sophisticated usage patterns

## ⚖️ Scoring Methodology

### Weighted Risk Scoring Model

Our scoring system uses a weighted linear combination approach with empirically determined weights:

```python
Risk Score = 500 + Σ(Feature_normalized × Weight)
```

### Weight Distribution

| Feature | Weight | Impact | Justification |
|---------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Borrow Ratio | +200 | High Risk | Unreturned borrowed amounts indicate potential defaults |
| Net Borrow Position | +180 | High Risk | Net borrowing positions increase liquidation risk |
| Inactivity Period | +150 | Medium Risk | Dormant accounts may indicate user disengagement |
| Current Balance Risk | +50 | Low Risk | Large positions require monitoring but aren't inherently risky |
| Account Age | -100 | Risk Reduction | Experienced users demonstrate protocol familiarity |
| Transaction Frequency | -80 | Risk Reduction | Active management reduces risk through engagement |
| Transaction Volume | -60 | Risk Reduction | More activity suggests sophisticated usage |
| Token Diversification | -40 | Risk Reduction | Spread across multiple assets reduces concentration risk |

### Score Normalization

- **Range**: 0-1000 (clamped to ensure bounds)
- **Baseline**: 500 (neutral risk starting point)
- **Categories**:
  - 0-300: 🟢 Low Risk
  - 301-600: 🟡 Medium Risk
  - 601-1000: 🔴 High Risk

## 🎯 Risk Indicators Justification

### High-Risk Indicators

#### 1. High Borrow Retention Ratio (Weight: +200)
- **Definition**: Percentage of borrowed funds not yet repaid
- **Justification**: Users who consistently maintain high borrowed positions relative to their borrowing history show signs of:
  - Potential cash flow issues
  - Over-leveraging behavior
  - Increased liquidation risk
- **Research Basis**: DeFi lending protocols show higher default rates among users with sustained borrowing positions

#### 2. Net Borrowing Position (Weight: +180)
- **Definition**: Current borrowed amount exceeding supplied collateral
- **Justification**: Net borrowers are exposed to:
  - Liquidation risk during market volatility
  - Interest rate risk on borrowed positions
  - Collateral requirement changes
- **Industry Standard**: Traditional finance considers net borrowing positions as primary risk factors

#### 3. Account Inactivity (Weight: +150)
- **Definition**: Extended periods without protocol interaction
- **Justification**: Inactive accounts may indicate:
  - User abandonment leading to position neglect
  - Reduced monitoring of liquidation risks
  - Potential loss of private key access
- **Empirical Evidence**: Abandoned DeFi positions show higher liquidation rates

### Risk-Reducing Indicators

#### 1. Account Maturity (Weight: -100)
- **Definition**: Time since first Compound protocol interaction
- **Justification**: Experienced users demonstrate:
  - Protocol familiarity reducing operational mistakes
  - Proven ability to navigate market cycles
  - Established risk management practices
- **Behavioral Finance**: Experience reduces cognitive biases in financial decision-making

#### 2. Transaction Frequency (Weight: -80)
- **Definition**: Regular protocol interactions normalized by account age
- **Justification**: Active users show:
  - Continuous portfolio monitoring
  - Responsive risk management
  - Engagement with protocol updates
- **Portfolio Theory**: Active management typically reduces tail risks

#### 3. Diversification (Weight: -40)
- **Definition**: Number of different Compound tokens utilized
- **Justification**: Diversified positions provide:
  - Reduced concentration risk
  - Lower correlation to single asset movements
  - Demonstration of sophisticated risk awareness
- **Modern Portfolio Theory**: Diversification is the only "free lunch" in finance
